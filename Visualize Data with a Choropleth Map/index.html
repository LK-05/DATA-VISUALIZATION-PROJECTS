	Designed and coded by <a href="http://www.joolian.com" target="_blank">Julian NF</a> for freeCodeCamp's <a href="https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map/">Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map</a>	project. Project built using plain-vanilla JavaScript, <a href="https://d3js.org/" title="Find out about D3">D3.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/topojson/topojson/wiki" target="_blank" title="Learn more about this powerful extension of GeoJSON">topoJSON</a>, SCSS, and two XMLHttpRequests for JSON files. No tooltip or legend librairies where used. First time building a Choropleth Chart and happy to report I finished it in two working days (9hrs + 8hrs), including research, debugging, and styling, as well as an ultimately ill-fated but valiant attempt to employ foreignObject to render the tooltips within the SVG.
